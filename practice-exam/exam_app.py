"""Desktop app for the CCAO-F practice exam.

Opens exam.html in a native window (pywebview) and exposes a small Python API
to the page: question generation through the local Claude Code CLI, and
progress persistence to exam_progress.json (gitignored). Run it with:

    python3 practice-exam/exam_app.py

Requires `pip install pywebview` and an authenticated Claude Code CLI for
dynamic generation; without the CLI the app still runs from the question bank.
